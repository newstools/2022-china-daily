A different language is a different vision of life. As one of the official languages of the Olympics, French has, over the years, become a portal towards a rich and diverse cultural realm. From March 10, the Francophonie Festival in China offers a variety of innovative programs for the upcoming month. Making appearances in many Chinese cities, the festival greets cultural lovers with spectacles, conferences, exhibitions, workshops, films and more. This year, Anaïs Martane, spouse of actor Liu Ye, has been named patron of the event. The French artist, whose latest inspiration led her to music, talked with China Daily about her unique bond with China and how language learning shapes her understanding of the world.
