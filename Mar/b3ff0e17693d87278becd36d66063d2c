BEIJING -- Despite the protracted pandemic and increasingly complex global environment, foreign companies are casting a vote of confidence in the Chinese economy as they continue to see opportunities amid the country's opening-up efforts. According to the 2022 China Business Climate Survey Report jointly released by the American Chamber of Commerce in China (AmCham China) and PwC, around 60 percent of the surveyed companies said they made profits in China in 2021, and two-thirds of them plan to increase their investment in China this year. Nearly two-thirds of AmCham China's member companies listed China as the world's top or among the top three investment destinations, the report said. Another report, released by the German Chamber of Commerce in China and KPMG, indicates that nearly 60 percent of German companies in China reported improved business operations last year and 71 percent of them plan further investment in China. China's undented attraction for foreign companies in a pandemic-jolted world came as a result of the country's steady economic recovery and improved business environment.
