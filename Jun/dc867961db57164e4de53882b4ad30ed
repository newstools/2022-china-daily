China conducted a land-based, mid-course missile interception test on Sunday night, and the test had achieved its goals, the Defense Ministry said. The ministry said in a brief statement that the operation was defensive and wasn't targeted at any other country. This was the sixth land-based, mid-course missile interception test China has publicly announced. Previously, the nation successfully completed five such tests in 2010, 2013, 2014, 2018 and 2021. A land-based, mid-course interception test typically involves several steps. The first step is the launch of a target ballistic missile. Then the missile surveillance satellites detect the launch and immediately inform ground-based early-warning systems to track the target and guide the interceptor toward it. The interceptor is fired and lock on the incoming missile before exploding itself near the target or directly hitting the target. An advanced anti-missile interceptor requires cutting-edge technologies, best manufacturing techniques and top materials and will only be successful after a great number of tests, experts said. So far, only a handful of countries such as the United States, Russia and China have developed and fielded anti-ballistic missile systems.
