The third volume of a compilation of President Xi Jinping's discourses on strengthening and rejuvenating the armed forces has been published and made available nationwide. As authorized by the Central Military Commission, the commission's Political Work Department organized the compilation and publication of the book, which presents Xi's insights about military work. Xi is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission. The nation's armed forces are urged to study the book to fully understand its essence so that all military officers and soldiers will be loyal to the Party and the people, and strive to make the armed forces even stronger, according to a circular issued recently by the Central Military Commission. Leading military officers should take the lead in studying the book and guide other officers and soldiers in the learning process, and put the theories into practice in order to constantly open up new prospects for strengthening combat readiness, the circular said.
