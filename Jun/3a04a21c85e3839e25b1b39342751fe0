China has lodged solemn representations with the United States over sanctions slapped on five Chinese companies, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Wednesday, urging the US to revoke them immediately. The US added the five companies in China to a trade blacklist on Tuesday for allegedly supporting Russia's military and defense industrial base, Reuters reported. Such sanctions have no foundation in international law, nor were they granted by the United Nations Security Council, Zhao said at a daily news conference. "They are unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction imposed by the US, and China has always opposed them firmly," he said, adding China will take every measure necessary to protect the lawful rights of the Chinese companies. The US, in handling its ties with Russia, must not undermine China's legitimate interests, Zhao said. "China and Russia carry out normal trade cooperation on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit. This should not be interfered with or restricted by any third party," he added. China has been playing a constructive role in promoting talks over the Ukraine issue, and has not provided military assistance to parties involved in the conflict, the Chinese embassy in the United States said in an interview with the Global Times newspaper on Wednesday. China and Russia have maintained normal cooperation in energy and trade, and the lawful interests of Chinese companies should not be harmed.
