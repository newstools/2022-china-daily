The fifth China International Import Expo will be held offline as scheduled from Nov 5 to 10 in Shanghai, the Paper reported on Wednesday quoting the China International Import Expo Bureau. Over 75 percent of exhibition areas have been signed by exhibitors, including more than 250 industrial leaders. The expo bureau said they will roll out special supportive measures for eligible exhibitors, such as fee relief for booth building, and will extend the sign-up period to July 31. In addition, the fifth CIIE will provide two-way information disclosure for purchasers and exhibitors for the first time. At present, 53 exhibits or services have their information published, and at least 400,000 purchasers who took part in the previous four CIIEs have received precisely targeted exhibit information via email and instant message. Preparations for country exhibitions are also progressing smoothly, with many countries confirming their participation. Prep work for activities such as the Hongqiao Forum, cultural exchange activities and on-site service guarantee are also underway. Over the past five years, the CIIE, as a global stage, has seen many vivid stories. The Bureau and National Exhibition and Convention Center (Shanghai) have launched a story collection activity inviting people to share their CIIE experiences such as meeting new clients and partners, opening up new markets and networking opportunities. The bureau said the CIIE has profoundly changed the work and life of many people, even those who have never visited the expo. A total of over 1,500 new products, technologies and services have been unveiled at past CIIEs, and cumulative intended turnover has reached more than $270 billion. Products that entered China's market via the CIIE save lives on operating tables, improve efficiency in workshops and are sold in numerous venues.
