A US athlete shot the "Xue Ruyi" on TikTok, and the video, which marveled the Great Wall next to the platform, went viral overseas and was praised by hundreds of thousands. "Xue Ruyi", or the National Ski Jumping Center, is located in Chongli district in Zhangjiakou, North China's Hebei province. Anna Hoffman, 21, is a ski jumper from the United States. While preparing for the competition, she shared a video shot of the Olympic venue. She pointed to the LED light going across the ridge line in the video and said that is actually the Great Wall. "Crazy to be ski jumping next to the great wall!" She posted with the video. Anna Hoffman also posted on Instagram Wednesday, expressing her gratitude for the Beijing Winter Olympics. "Thank you Beijing for the experience of a lifetime and all the memories. I had a blast this week and am so grateful for this opportunity. There's a lot more for me to learn on the ski jump but this was a great milestone in my career."
