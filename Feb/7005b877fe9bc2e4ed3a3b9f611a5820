Ever since Beijing won the bid to host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games back in 2015, excitement toward snow and ice sports in China has grown exponentially, with skiing and ice skating venues popping up all over the country. A case in point is Changsha Xiangjiang Happy City, a veritable snow paradise that has witnessed its visitor numbers soar, especially since the summer of 2020. Since July 1 of that year, the indoor ski venue in Changsha, Hunan province, has welcomed some 400,000 visitors. The center is busiest in summer, welcoming around 2,500 visitors through its doors on a daily basis. "In the southern part of China, where there is hardly any snow, many people didn't know much about skiing before. Now, more and more people are willing to learn about it and try the sport. In terms of the market, the positioning of indoor ski venues in the region is similar to theme parks," said Liu Yu, a Changsha Xiangjiang Happy City salesperson. "Many companies in the southern part of China like to organize group ski outings for their staff, while local residents tend to prefer going skiing than other group events," Liu said.
