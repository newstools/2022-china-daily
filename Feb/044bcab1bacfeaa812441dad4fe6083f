This year's Spring Festival was the second that Huang Wei-hung, an ice hockey coach from Taiwan, spent in Wuhan, Hubei province, where he is avidly following the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics on TV with his students, cheering for the Chinese athletes. Huang, 42, arrived in Wuhan in 2020 to try his luck as an ice hockey coach. His decision to move to the city has certainly paid off, as it came as local schools were opening related courses and more children were getting involved in the sport. He now has around 70 students and a growing business. Ice hockey, which remains a niche sport on the mainland, is a winter team game played on ice skates with the object of propelling a vulcanized rubber disk, the puck, into the net. The sport is immensely popular in Canada, where it is the national winter sport.
