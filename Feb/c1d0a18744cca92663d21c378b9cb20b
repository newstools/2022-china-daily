In his message, Xi said that he and his wife Peng Liyuan extended sincere sympathy to Erdogan and his wife Emine Erdogan, after learning about their infection. China will continue to firmly support Turkey in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, he added. On Saturday, Erdogan said on a social media platform that he and his wife had been infected with the Omicron variant of the virus and have mild symptoms of COVID-19. Xi also said in the message that he attaches great importance to the development of China-Turkey relations and is ready to work with Erdogan to continuously push forward the two countries' strategic cooperative relationship to a new level.
