The Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic torch relay kicked off at a section of the Winter Olympic Park in Beijing on Wednesday. Wang Meng, a Turin and Vancouver Winter Olympics champion for short-track speed skating, was the first torchbearer at this station. Wang said she is very lucky and proud to be a "dual-Olympic torchbearer", having also participated in the relay for the city's Summer Olympics in 2008. The promotion of winter sports in China has been very successful in recent years, and more people have enjoyed ice and snow sports, Wang said. Watch this video to see more!
