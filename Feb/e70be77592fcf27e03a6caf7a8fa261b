Chinese bicycle exports have soared during the past two years as bicycle demand from overseas consumers has increased for social-distancing and health concerns. China bicycle exports rose 14.9 percent to 69.26 million units in 2021, according to customs data. Export value jumped 40.2 percent to $5.11 billion, indicating a high-end trend in exports. "Phoenix Bicycle exported around 4 million units of bicycles in 2021, accounting for 30 percent of company sales," said Sheng Kai, business manager of Shanghai Phoenix Bicycle Co Ltd, according to a People's Daily report on Friday. Europe, the United States and Japan account for 64 percent of the company's exports, Sheng said, adding that the two mergers and acquisitions in Tianjin in 2020 have doubled the company's exports. Tianjin Golden Wheel Group tallied sales of 3.1 billion yuan ($487.45 million) in 2020 and 5 billion yuan in 2021, according to group president Yang Yufeng. The 250,000 electric bicycles and 2 million bicycles produced by the group each year have all contributed to its exports, which covers more than 120 countries and regions. "Bicycles exported cover a variety of types, including mountain bicycles, folding bicycles, children's bicycles and electric bicycles," Yang said. Besides entire bicycle exports, the exports of bicycle parts also soared as the pandemic hindered certain transmission producers in supplying parts, according to Liu Chunsheng, founder and president of Zhuhai Ltwoo Controller Technology Co, Ltd. "Some suppliers in the US and Japan have extended the delivery cycle to as long as two years," he said. "We could deliver within a month." According to Guo Wenyu, secretary-general of the China Bicycle Association, Chinese bicycle enterprises have made major progress in the R&D and innovation of core components. "The quick response of domestic suppliers amid the pandemic-stricken era has guaranteed healthy development of the industry," he said.
