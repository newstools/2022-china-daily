The month of May is recognized as Africa month – a time when the continent commemorates the founding of the Organization of African Unity. In China, a group of Africans are also celebrating and sharing their stories with China Daily. "It's an opportunity for us to showcase Africa to the world to show the beauty and diverse culture," said Justina Obaoye-Ajala from Nigeria, who is the president of the African Diaspora in China Network. Obaoye-Ajala said the relationship between Africa and China has been mutually beneficial, as seen in educational and cultural exchanges as well as economic development and partnership. "Celebrating African Day is one of our greatest joys as African people. Even though we are not on the continent, we still carry African nature within us," said Sarah Marjorey Kisakye from Uganda, a PhD student at the Communication University of China. Speaking of African culture, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, founder of Africa China Leadership Association, said she would pick Afro music to showcase to her Chinese friends as music is a universal language. Diallo Mohamad from Guinea, a fiber optic products salesman, said he would recommend the renowned jollof rice dish to his Chinese friends.
