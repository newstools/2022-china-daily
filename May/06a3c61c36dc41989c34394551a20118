The momentum toward stabilizing the job market is good despite the heavy impact of the epidemic on employment, thanks to a recovering economy and State-level support. Yu Jiadong, vice-minister of Human Resources and Social Security, said in a recent interview with Xinhua News Agency that the domestic job market has shown an increase since earlier this year. "In the first month, 4.06 million new jobs were created in urban areas where the unemployment rate was around 5.5 percent, which is within reasonable limits," he said. "We still face difficulties, although the overall situation is stable. Employment data shows fluctuations in March, so we are still experiencing pressure in promoting jobs." Yu said that the ministry will continue to implement its employment-first policy and release more detailed measures to help people land jobs. He added that college graduates and migrant workers are the two key group requiring greater attention and assistance from administrative departments, and that the ministry will make training courses more accessible to help relieve structural imbalances in the job market. "To those who are jobless, we offer free guidance and job information. Those with difficulties finding a job will be offered tailored services and basic living insurance," he added.
