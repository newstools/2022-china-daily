Pakistani Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari arrived in China on Saturday for a two-day visit at the invitation of State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the first official bilateral visit since he assumed office last month. The visit marks the first high-level in-person interaction between the two countries since the new Pakistani government was formed and also coincides with the 71st anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Pakistan. Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a daily news briefing on Friday that China hoped to take the visit as an opportunity to renew their bilateral traditional friendship and consolidate strategic mutual trust. It is also hoped to further deepen the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership and build a closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era, he added. "As all-weather strategic cooperative partners, it is necessary for China and Pakistan to strengthen communication and coordination on major strategic issues in a timely manner, and jointly respond to new developments in international and regional situations and their various risks and challenges," said the spokesman. According to a Pakistani press release, the two foreign ministers would review the entire gamut of bilateral relations, with a particular focus on stronger trade and economic cooperation between the two countries and have a wide-ranging exchange of views on major regional and international issues. The progress of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the flagship project of the Belt and Road Initiative, would also be featured in the discussions.
