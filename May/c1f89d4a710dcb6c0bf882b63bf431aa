Fifteen out of the 16 districts in Shanghai have eliminated COVID transmissions outside quarantine areas, said Zong Ming, vice-mayor of the city. At present, the number of people living in "closed-off management areas" has dropped to no more than 1 million, and the epidemic has been effectively brought under control, said Zong at a press conference held on Monday. The city will fully return to normalcy in June, according to the press conference. Zong said Shanghai will also gradually resume public transport starting May 22. The megacity, which has a population of over 24 million, reported 69 confirmed locally transmitted COVID-19 cases and 869 local asymptomatic cases on Sunday, the first time that new daily infections dropped to below 1,000 since March 24.
