The leadership of the Communist Party of China held a meeting on Friday to deliberate on a regulation on the Party's work regarding political consultation, urging efforts to create strong synergy in building a modern socialist China and realizing national rejuvenation. The meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee was presided over by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee. Political consultation is an important component of the CPC-led multiparty cooperation and political consultation system, and a major form of socialist consultative democracy, the meeting's participants said. They said that political consultation serves as a major channel for pooling wisdom, expanding consensus and promoting scientific and democratic decision-making. The regulation is of great significance in strengthening the Party's leadership over political consultation work, refining China's new model of political party system and broadening the patriotic united front, they said. They stressed implementing Xi's important thoughts on strengthening and improving united front work as well as the work of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and upholding and strengthening the Party's overall leadership to ensure the right political orientation and the efficiency of political consultation. The meeting's participants also stressed efforts to build consensus through political consultation and achieve unity in understanding fundamental and major issues, in order to closely unite all sectors around the Party and form synergy in building China into a modern socialist country in all respects and achieving national rejuvenation. Since the 18th National Congress of the CPC in 2012, the CPC Central Committee has organized or entrusted relevant departments to organize more than 170 consultative forums, according to a white paper entitled "China: Democracy That Works", which was released in December. The white paper said that the central committees of the non-Communist parties, together with personages without party affiliation, have conducted in-depth field work and made more than 730 written proposals, many of which have become major State policies.
