Many Americans have a pessimistic attitude toward the US economy and have financial pressure in their lives, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SQL Server Reporting Services, CNN politics reported. President Joe Biden got sharp, negative ratings for handling the economy, the authors argue in the article. The authors continue saying most adults in the US say Biden's policies have hurt the economy and 81 percent of people say the government should do more to combat inflation in the US. Besides, 73 percent people think the government is doing little to fix the supply chain, and 49 percent think the same about student loan debt. According to the Poll, 81 percent of Americans don't think Biden's policies have improved US's economy, among which 26 percent of people say the policies are useless and 55 percent think they have made conditions in the US worse. As the gas and food prices are soaring in the US, most people's economic conditions have changed, said the Poll. 63 percent people have reduced nonessential spending and changed their habits of buying groceries, and 54 percent have greatly cut back on driving. Also, about one-third of the people say it is difficult to find affordable housing. Some of people's hardships have been spreading widely since last year, and around half of the American population hold the opinion that the most important national issue is the economy, added the Poll.
