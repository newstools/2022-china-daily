To shield residents from the parcels that might be contaminated by novel coronavirus, a community in Shanghai has recently set up a "disinfection cabin" to sterilize parcels it receives. It is a transparent and enclosed room that can spray disinfectants onto the parcels, which lowers the risk of getting infected with COVID-19 for about 2,000 residents living in the community.
