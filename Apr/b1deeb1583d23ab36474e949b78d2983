Discoveries ranging from the exotic-looking gold and bronze masks from the Sanxingdui Ruins site in Sichuan province to the mausoleum of a famous emperor from over 2,000 years ago are among the brightest stars of China's archaeological finds last year. China's Top 10 New Archaeological Discoveries of 2021, the updated version of a widely anticipated annual list that has garnered attention far beyond academic circles, was released on Thursday. The 10 were chosen from among the 20 final-round candidates by 21 of the country's top scholars via open ballot.
