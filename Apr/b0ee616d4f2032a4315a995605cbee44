President calls for quicker steps in building port President Xi Jinping underlined on Wednesday the significance of developing the Hainan Free Trade Port into a landmark project showcasing the best of China, saying that the port should give high priority to innovation at the institutional level. In remarks made at a meeting with officials from Hainan province on Wednesday－the final day of his four-day inspection trip－Xi called for quicker steps in building a free trade port with Chinese characteristics and global influence and enabling the province to lead the way in China's reform and opening-up in the new era. During the trip, Xi, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, visited Sanya, Wuzhishan and Danzhou and spoke with workers from research institutions, a national park and a port, as well as residents from a village of the Li ethnic group. He noted that the building of a free trade port in Hainan is a complex and systemic project that would be a long-term endeavor. The development of the Hainan Free Trade Port was proposed by Xi in 2018 at a meeting marking the 30th anniversary of the Hainan Special Economic Zone.
