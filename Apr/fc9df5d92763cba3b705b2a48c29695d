Wang Yong, a volunteer during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei province in 2020, now helps people in Shanghai, the current virus-hit city, by ferrying messages back and forth through his network of volunteers, Chinanews.com reported. On Wednesday morning, Wang Yong, Party secretary of the Hankou branch of Shunfeng Express, one of the country's largest logistics companies, received another request for help. "Brother Yong, the elder's medicine is hard to buy. Can you help me?" asked a medical worker in Shanghai who had also fought against the epidemic in Wuhan. "Don't worry, leave the phone number and address, I will find a way to solve it as soon as possible," replied Wang, who had developed a good relationship with volunteers and medics from other places during the Wuhan fight in 2020. During the outbreak in Wuhan, Wang ran a massive network of volunteers who helped medical personnel go to work, return home and order food. The volunteers also collect daily necessities and medical supplies from donors. Now, Shanghai was hit hard by the Omicron variant and the city carried out strict epidemic prevention and control measures. Wang learned from his Shanghai friends that some resources such as drugs and daily necessities were in urgent demand. He has been coordinating volunteers and enterprises across the country since last weekend to ensure supplies of daily necessities reach those in need in Shanghai.
