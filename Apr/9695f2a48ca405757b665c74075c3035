Here are the highlights: - No difficulties could ever stop the wheel of history. Faced with the many challenges, we must not lose confidence, hesitate or flinch. Instead, we must firm up confidence and press ahead against all odds. - To break through the mist and embrace a bright future, the biggest strength comes from cooperation and the most effective way is through solidarity. - Xi proposed a Global Security Initiative to promote security for all in the world. - Security is the precondition for development and humanity are living in an indivisible security community. - It has been proven time and again that the Cold War mentality would only wreck the global peace framework, that hegemonism and power politics would only endanger world peace, and that bloc confrontation would only exacerbate security challenges in the 21st century.
