In the last decade since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012, there have been some extraordinary changes within China and with regard to the world's perception of China, said Carlos Martinez, co-editor of London-based Friends of Socialist China, a platform that is promoting understanding about China. Eradicating extreme poverty in a developing country of 1.4 billion people, which just a few decades ago was among the poorest countries in the world, is a historic achievement, said Martinez. He also added that this reflects China's socialist democratic system, which prioritizes the needs of the people above all other concerns. Martinez also said that China has established itself as a responsible power and world leader with regard to climate change, by committing to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2060. "That will make China the fastest country to peak its carbon emissions following industrialization, and by far the fastest to go from peak emissions to net zero," said Martinez. "In the last 10 years, China has done a great job for its people and for humanity as a whole, and no doubt it will continue to do so."
