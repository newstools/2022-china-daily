Olympic champion snowboarder and Beijing Paralympic heroes share the love Mature beyond his 18 years, snowboard superstar Su Yiming is happy to embrace his new-found role-model status, and is especially pleased to learn that China's Paralympic heroes have been inspired by his history-making feats. Su became a household name in China at Beijing 2022 in February by becoming the nation's first Olympic gold medalist in men's snowboard Big Air, after bagging a slopestyle silver. Among the tens of millions across the country to be inspired by Su's heroics was Ji Lijia, who won gold in the snowboard men's cross SB-UL event at the Winter Paralympics in March. "It's a pity that we can't meet in person right now due to the pandemic. After I found out we would have a chance to communicate, I couldn't sleep properly for two nights. So I'm glad to know you," Ji told Su in a video message. "I remember I was so nervous watching your Big Air and slopestyle competitions at the Winter Olympics. I was so thrilled when you won. I hope you can stay healthy in the future and win more honor for our nation. "I also hope you can continue to raise your level in the future. As you said yourself, we need to love what we do and keep fighting for it to achieve our dreams. You have a very promising future, so keep on fighting, Su!"
