The Russia-Ukraine conflict is still going on, with innumerable families suffering. However, on the other side of the Earth, some people are counting their bloody money. They are the US arms dealers and those in the US military-industrial complex. These US parasites suck blood globally. Wherever there is a conflict, there are their weapons. They have sold nuclear submarine technology to Australia threatening regional peace; They sell weapons to Taiwan to try and prevent China's reunification; They sell weapons to the Middle East, making things even messier. They even sell rifles to US people, who face the risk of being shot every day. They make money, and the people of the world pay the price. Ironically, it is the same US that calls for "peace and human rights". Time to refute their lies so that the world knows the truth.
