President Xi Jinping has called on veteran professors at the University of Science and Technology Beijing to nurture more quality talent for the country, promote the steel industry's innovative growth and boost green and low-carbon development. Xi, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, expressed his hope on Thursday in a letter replying to the professors. Founded in 1952, the university was previously known as the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, and it was the People's Republic of China's first college focused on the iron and steel industry. Fifteen senior professors at the university wrote to Xi recently, briefing him on the university's progress over the past seven decades and expressing their resolve to cultivate more talent for the high-quality development of the country's steel and iron industry. In his letter of reply, Xi extended his congratulations to faculty, students and alumni of the university as it marks its 70th anniversary, saying that it has made a profound contribution to China's steel industry. Xi noted that the nation's rejuvenation requires major talent with both integrity and professionalism. He called on the university to build on its great scholastic spirit and dedication to education, further develop its own features and nurture more high-caliber talent following the Party's lead and having strong ideals and professional skills. Xi encouraged the university to make greater contributions in its efforts to build the country into a major player in science, technology and manufacturing.
