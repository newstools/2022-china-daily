China hosted the third meeting of the foreign ministers of Afghanistan's neighboring countries in Tunxi, East China's Anhui province, on March 30-31. Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi chaired the meeting with the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Iran, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan or their representatives. Wang said that with Afghanistan standing at the crossroads of history, relevant countries launched the coordination and cooperation mechanism among neighbors of Afghanistan and built a political consensus of cooperating to respond to the changes in the Afghan situation. These moves fully embodied the spirit of good-neighborly friendship and mutual assistance. Foreign ministers of countries attending the meeting agreed to step up coordination and cooperation to help Afghanistan realize peace, stability, and economic reconstruction, and support and guide the Afghan interim government to faithfully fulfill its commitments and respond positively to the expectations of the international community, especially its neighbors.
