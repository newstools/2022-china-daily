 Polls across Japan opened Sunday morning for an upper house election taking place just two days after former prime minister Shinzo Abe was assassinated while on the campaign trail. The vote is expected to expand the majority of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and other politicians have insisted the shock killing would not halt the democratic process. He took time to pay condolences at Abe's family home in Tokyo, where the former premier's body arrived on Saturday afternoon from a hospital in western Japan. The assassination, which occurred on Friday, rattled the nation and sent shockwaves around the world. The man accused of his murder, 41-year-old Tetsuya Yamagami, is in custody and has told investigators he targeted Abe because he believed the politician was linked to an unnamed organization. Yamagami believed the former Japanese leader was linked to a religious group he blamed for his mother's financial ruin and spent months planning the attack with a homemade gun, police told local media on Saturday.
