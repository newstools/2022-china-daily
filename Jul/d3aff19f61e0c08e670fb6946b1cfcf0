Beijing will offer vouchers worth 100 million yuan ($14.92 million) to spur consumption in the catering sector this year, Beijing Daily reported. The coupons will be available both online and offline from July, and preparations are underway for the rollout, Guo Wenjie, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Commerce Bureau, said on Thursday. The funds will come from the Beijing municipal government and platform enterprises to help restaurants recover, Guo added. A batch of new consumption landmarks will also be built in the city, and more efforts will be made to integrate online and offline consumption. Enterprises that made outstanding contributions to online consumption this year will be awarded no more than 20 million yuan.
