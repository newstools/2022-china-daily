COLOMBO - Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Saturday informed the country's parliament speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena that he will resign from office on July 13. The speaker's office told Xinhua that the president disclosed his decision following a request made by political party leaders. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has agreed to resign earlier in the day after party leaders in the parliament urged both him and the president to step down. On Saturday, protesters stormed the president's residence and office, and the prime minister's house was set on fire.
